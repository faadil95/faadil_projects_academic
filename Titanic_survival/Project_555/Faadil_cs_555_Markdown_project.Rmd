## **Explanatory Data Analysis**



``` {r Explaratory Data Analysis}

df_dummy <- fastDummies::dummy_cols(df_clean,
select_columns = c("Sex","Embarked"))
colnames(df_dummy)
df_dummy <- df_dummy[c(1,2,4,5,6,7,9,10,12,13,14)]

```


## **Logistic Regression**

Building logistic regression classification models with below classes.

logistic regression of survived passengers as a function of passenger class. Passenger class is significant in determining the survival at 95% confidence interval

``` {r Logistic Regression}

## Passenger Class:
m <- glm(Survived~Pclass, 
         data = df_dummy , family = binomial)
summary(m)

```



##Adjusting for age:

Ran anova test on the following logistic regression model.

Categorical variable: passenger class

Covariate : Age

They are both significant in determining the survival of passenger

``` {r Logistic RRegression}
library(car)
Anova(glm(Survived~Pclass + Age, 
         data = df_dummy , family = binomial), type = 3, test.statistic = "F")
```


## Regression with Gender

Looking below we can determine gender is significant in determining the survival of passenger

``` {r Logisticc Regression}

m <- glm(Survived~Sex_female, 
         data = df_dummy , family = binomial)
summary(m)

```


#Adjusting for age:

Ran anova test on the followinglogistic regression model.

Categorical variable: Sex

Covariate : Age

Both are significant together in determining survival

``` {r Annova Sex}
Anova(glm(Survived~Sex_female+Age, 
          data = df_dummy , family = binomial), type = 3, test.statistic = "F")

```


## Family

Looking below we can determine Family is significant in determining the survival of passenger

``` {r Anova Family}
m <- glm(Survived~Parch, 
         data = df_dummy , family = binomial)
summary(m)
```


#Adjusting for age:

Ran anova test on the following logistic regression model.

Categorical variable: family

Covariate : Age

Both are not significant at 95 % CI to determine survival

``` {r Anova Family adjusting age}
Anova(glm(Survived~Parch+Age, 
          data = df_dummy , family = binomial), type = 3, test.statistic = "F")

```


## Siblings

Looking below we can determine sibling is not significant 

``` {r Anova with Siblings}

m <- glm(Survived~SibSp, 
         data = df_dummy , family = binomial)
summary(m)

```


#Adjusting for age:

Ran anova test on the following logistic regression model.

Categorical variable: Sibling

Covariate : Age

Both are not significant at 95 % CI to determine survival

``` {r Anova sibling with age}
Anova(glm(Survived~SibSp+Age, 
          data = df_dummy , family = binomial), type = 3, test.statistic = "F")

```

## **Logistic Regression Classification Model**

Fare is not significant in determining survival at  95% CI.

``` {r Final Logistic Regression}
#building the final logistic regression classification model

set.seed(64)
split = sample.split(df_dummy$Survived, SplitRatio = 0.8)
training_set = subset(df_dummy, split == TRUE)
test_set = subset(df_dummy, split == FALSE)
training_set[-1] = scale(training_set[-1])
test_set[-1] = scale(test_set[-1])

classifier = glm(formula = Survived ~Pclass+Sex_female+Fare+Age,
                 family = binomial,
                 data = training_set)

summary(classifier)
```

## **Predicting Test Set Results**

We have used threshold as 0.5 to perform classification.

``` {r Test Reuslts}
# Predicting the Test set results
model.probs <- predict(classifier, test_set, type = "response")
model.pred <- rep(0, length(model.probs))
model.pred[model.probs > 0.5] <- 1
```

## **Confusion Matrix**

TN = 48
FP = 10
FN = 11
TP = 31

```{r Confusion Matrix}
# Making the Confusion Matrix
table(model.pred, test_set$Survived)

# Accuracy 
1- mean(model.pred != test_set$Survived)

# ROC curve
#install.packages("pROC")
library(pROC)
g <- roc(test_set$Survived ~ model.probs)
print(g)
plot(g, main = "ROC curve") 



```

## **Summary**

We conclude that Passenger Class, gender were the significant parameters in survival. Initially, the female gender parameter showed some sort of correlation with passenger survival. These parameters were: Pclass, gender, age, Fare and # of family members. ANCOVA was performed, adjusting for age on such parameters, and finally it was found that age wasnâ€™t a significant predictor if gender is the predictor. And, finally, Pclass, gender, and fare were the only significant predictors, once adjusted for age.
Based on a logistic regression model, using Pclass, gender, Fare as its features, we could predict the survival with an accuracy of 79%. Another assessment of this model, the ROC curve, showed good results as the area under the ROC curve was 0.815.
