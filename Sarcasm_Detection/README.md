# Proposed Topic: Sarcasm Detection.

We would like to create our own project based on sentiment analysis by detecting sarcasm taken from short text data (for example social media data).

Packages to install for running the code :-

Panda for data analysis
Numpy for working with arrays

Matplotlib for plotting graphs
seaborn for data visualization and exploratory data analysis
Plotly.express  is used for visualize variety of data types

You have to import NLTK ( Natural language tool kit) that is used for statistical natural language processing as it contains libraries for tokenization, parsing, classification, tagging, stemming, and semantic reasoning.

Scikit-learn is probably the most useful library for
machine learning in Python
The sklearn library contains is used for including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction.

We have used four algorithms namely :-
SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM)
DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER
ADA BOOST CLASSFIER
LOGISTIC REGRESSION

These algorithms extract data from the whole dataset.
All the accuracy reports can be found in the code provided as well as in the report.
